## Knative Community Calendar

Knative has a shared [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=knative.team_9q83bg07qs5b9rrslp5jor4l6s@group.calendar.google.com)
where all the events related to Knative are. This includes Working Group,
Steering Committee, Community, etc. meetings.

Access to add new events to the calendar is available to folks that have a
@knative.team account. Currently, this is limited to:

* Working Group leads
* Steering Committee members
* Knative Trademark Committee members

However, if there are other folks that have a need to have a @knative.team
account, please file an issue with Steering Committee, or send an email to
`steering@knative.team` to request an account to be created and a short reasoning.

If there are other members of the community that need to manage the Knative
team calendar on ongoing basis, please reach out to Steering Committee and
we can either create a knative.team account, or share the calendar with your
existing account (at least in some cases).

If there's a one-off calendar invite needed, please send an email to
`calendar-maintainers@knative.team` with the details of the event and we can
create the event for you.
