## Committee Mechanics

The TOC is [elected by the community](./mechanics/TOC.md).

The TOC’s work includes:

- Regular committee meetings to discuss hot topics, resulting in a set of
  published
  [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LzOUbTMkMEsCRfwjYm5TKZUWfyXpO589-r9K2rXlHfk/edit).

- Create, review, approve and publish technical project governance documents.

- Create proposals for consideration by individual working groups to help steer
  their work towards a common project-wide objective.

- Review/address/comment on project issues.

- Act as a high-level sounding board for technical questions or designs bubbled
  up by the working groups.

## Committee Meeting

Community members are encouraged to suggest topics for discussion ahead of the
TOC meetings, and are invited to observe these meetings and engage with the TOC
during the community feedback period at the end of each meeting.
