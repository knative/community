Knative is a vendor-neutral project under the [CNCF](https://cncf.io/).
Knative has used a number of different governance models in the past. The
_current_ governance of the Knative project is managed by the [Knative Steering
Committee](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md), which delegates much of the technical work
to different [working groups](./working-groups/WORKING-GROUPS.md), which are
focused on specific components of Knative.

All participants in the Knative project are contributors, and are expected to
follow the [CNCF Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md); contributors who
reach a minimum level of interactions ([currently 25 interactions in 12
months](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md#eligibility-to-vote)) are eligible to
participate in [steering committee
elections](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md#election-procedure).  Other roles in the
project are awarded based on participation, see [ROLES.md](./ROLES.md) for
details on the permissions and requirements for other roles.
