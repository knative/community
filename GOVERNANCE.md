Knative Governance is broken into two components. At a high level, the Knative
Steering Committee (KSC) is the "root" level governance body.
The Tech Oversight Committee (TOC) operates
entirely within the governance definitions delineated by the KSC.

## Community and Operations

The [Knative Steering Committee](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md) is responsible for the
general health of the Knative community. Responsibilities include maintaining
the governance framework, code of conduct, community meetings, communication
platforms, and test resources.

## Trademarks

The [Knative Steering Committee](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md) is responsible for
management, licensing, and conformance verification of Knative logos, names, and
trademarks, including the definition of what "Knative" is and the definition and
rules for usage of derived marks.

## Technology and Software Implementation

The [Knative Technical Oversight Committee](./TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) is
responsible for the technical oversight, release process, and integration of the
technology components of the Knative project. Most day-to-day work is delegated
by the TOC to various subject-specific working groups.
