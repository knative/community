# Introduction

Security is core to our values, and we value the input of developers, operators,
security researchers, and others acting in good faith to help us maintain a high
standard for the security and privacy for our users, and their users. This
includes encouraging responsible vulnerability research and disclosure. This
policy sets out our definition of good faith in the context of finding and
reporting vulnerabilities, as well as what you can expect from us in return.

# Expectations

When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

- Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this
  policy;
- Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely
  initial response to the submission;
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner;
- Publicly disclose accepted vulnerabilities in a timely manner; and
- Recognize your contribution to improving our security if you are the first to
  report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or
  configuration change.

TODO: Is Knative Security up for including the recognize clause? Do we have a
page for this?

# Ground Rules

To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between
good-faith hacking and malicious attack, we ask that you:

- Play by the rules. This includes following this policy, as well as any other
  relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any
  other relevant terms, the terms of this policy will prevail;
- Report any vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered promptly;
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting out-of-scope systems,
  destroying data, and/or harming user experience;
- Use only the [Official Channels](#reporting-a-vulnerability) to discuss
  vulnerability information with us;
- Keep the details of any discovered vulnerabilities confidential until they are
  fixed, according to the Disclosure Policy;
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities
  which are out-of-scope;
- If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of
  data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof
  of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter
  any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information
  (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary
  information;
- You should only interact with test accounts and Knative instances you own or
  with explicit permission from the account holder; and
- Do not engage in extortion.

# Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider
this research to be:

- Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or
  similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against
  you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
- Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring
  a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with
  conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited
  basis for work done under this policy; and
- Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good
  faith.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research
is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our
[Official Channels](#reporting-a-vulnerability) before going any further.

# Scope and Supported Versions

We (the community) support the 4 most recent minor versions of Knative. For more
details on what this means, see our
[release principles](https://knative.dev/community/contributing/mechanics/release-versioning-principles/).

Repos with releases have the releases listed in the Github UI:

TODO: move this list elsewhere?

- [serving](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases)
- [eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases)
- [client](https://github.com/knative/client/releases)
- [operator](https://github.com/knative/operator/releases)
- [eventing-contrib](https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/releases)
- [docs](https://github.com/knative/docs/releases)

Repos without releases are supported only on the default branch.

TODO: Alternative: Vulnerabilities in repos without releases are in scope only
if they can be exploited in a release.

TODO: any other repos with releases? TODO: what about knative-sandbox?

No support is provided for archived repos.

# Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email the
[Knative Security Committee](mailto:knative-security@googlegroups.com) with
confidential vulnerability reports. Someone from the committee will get back to
you within 3 business days. Accepted reports will be fixed within 90 calendar
days via a minor release and/or one or more patch release(s) for minor versions
that are both affected and supported at that point.

We ask that you keep reports confidential for the full 90 days, or until the
committee releases you from the confidentiality, whichever comes first, as we
coordinate disclosures with Knative partners who may need some time after the
vulnerability is addressed in Knative in order to update to their systems.

TODO: security isn't a listed working group, receiving security reports is
described as a function of Steering, and there's not "security committee" listed
anywhere. So what is Security and who's on it?
https://knative.dev/community/contributing/working-groups/working-groups/
https://knative.dev/community/contributing/steering-committee/

TODO: GPG or other tools for ensuring confidentiality of the report?

## What's in a report?

Ideal reports are in English and include a description of the vulnerability, a
proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating the vulnerability, and a statement of
what this vulnerability puts at risk.

The security committee may make a best-effort attempt to address reports that do
not meet these standards.

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

Knative Security engages with partners, including vendors that host
Knative-based products, to responsibly disclose newly discovered
vulnerabilities.

# Vulnerability Rewards

Knative itself has no vulnerability report reward program.

Some vulnerability reports may be eligible for rewards through programs from
vendors, such as those with products based on Knative. Reporters should comply
with program rules to receive these rewards; the Knative community will not
submit reports for rewards on the reporter's behalf.

Vendors with relevant reward programs:

- [Google](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/index.html)

TODO: others? remove list of reward programs for vendor-neutrality?
