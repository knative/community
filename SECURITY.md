# Knative security policy

## Introduction

Security is core to our values, and we value the input of developers, operators,
security researchers, and others acting in good faith to help us maintain a high
standard for the security and privacy for our users, and their users. This
includes encouraging responsible vulnerability research and
[coordinated disclosure](#coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure). This policy
sets out our definition of good faith in the context of finding and reporting
vulnerabilities, as well as what you can expect from us in return.

_If you have identified a vulnerability in Knative, please do not post an issue
in the public issue tracker. Instead, please follow the coordinated disclosure
policy described in this document._

## Expectations

When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

- Extend [Safe Harbor](#safe-harbor) for your vulnerability research that is
  related to this policy;
- Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely
  initial response to the submission;
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in
  [supported versions](#scope-and-supported-versions) in a timely manner;
- [Coordinate disclosure](#coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure) with vendors in
  our CVD program;
- Publicly disclose accepted vulnerabilities in a timely manner; and
- Recognize your contribution to improving our security if you are the first to
  report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or
  configuration change.

## Ground Rules

To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between
good-faith hacking and malicious attack, we ask that you:

- Play by the rules. This includes following this policy, as well as any other
  relevant agreements, particularly the Knative
  [Code of Conduct](https://knative.dev/community/contributing/code-of-conduct/).
  If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other relevant
  terms, the terms of this policy will prevail;
- Report any vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered promptly;
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting out-of-scope systems,
  destroying data, and/or harming user experience;
- Use only the [Official Channels](#reporting-a-vulnerability) to discuss
  vulnerability information with us;
- Keep the details of any discovered vulnerabilities confidential until they are
  fixed, according to our
  [Coordinated Disclosure Policy](#coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure);
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities
  which are out-of-scope;
- If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of
  data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof
  of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter
  any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information
  (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary
  information;
- You should only interact with test accounts and Knative instances you own or
  with explicit permission from the owner or account holder; and
- Do not engage in extortion.

## Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider
this research to be:

- Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or
  similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against
  you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
- Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring
  a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with
  conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited
  basis for work done under this policy; and
- Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good
  faith.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research
is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our
[Official Channels](#reporting-a-vulnerability) before going any further.

## Scope and Supported Versions

We (the community) support the 4 most recent minor versions of Knative. For more
details on what this means, see our
[release principles](https://knative.dev/community/contributing/mechanics/release-versioning-principles/).

While we encourage you to report vulnerabilities in any Knative repo, at HEAD or
the tip of any release branch (release-X.Y), we commit to patching
vulnerabilities only at HEAD and in currently supported release branches.

Repos with releases have the releases listed in the Github UI, _e.g._:

- [serving](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases)
- [eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases)

Repos in Knative Sandbox that have no releases listed may have a higher bar for
accepting vulnerability reports. No support is provided for archived repos.

<!-- TODO: Is CI/CD/test/etc infrastructure in scope, or leave that TBD? -->

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email the
[Knative Security list](mailto:knative-security@googlegroups.com) with the
following information:

<!-- TODO: Should we have a more specific/specialized email list for reports? -->

- a repo and version/branch that contains the vulnerability
- a description of the vulnerability (_e.g.,_ specifically malformed input to X
  results in buffer overlow in function Y)
- potential implications (_e.g.,_ remote code execution)
- ideally, a repro case (this is preferred but optional)

_Please avoid sharing any details with anyone beyond the Knative Security
vulnerability mitigation team to allow time for the report to be triaged._

Someone from the list will get back to you within 3 business days. Accepted
vulnerability reports will be fixed within 90 calendar days via one or more
releases for versions that are both affected and supported at that point.
Typical outcomes for reports include:

- _Working as intended_ - We will explain our understanding of the situation;
  please let us know if you believe we've misunderstood it. You may wish to file
  a feature request.
- _Bug_ - Knative is not working as intended, but this doesn't meet our bar for
  handling as an accepted vulnerability. Please file this issue as a normal bug
  through the GitHub issue tracking for the affected repo(s).
- _Not reproducible_ - We were unable to reproduce the vulnerability. In some
  cases, we may not have received enough details from you, even after followup.
- _Vulnerability_ - This is a vulnerability and we will address it.

We ask that you keep accepted vulnerability reports confidential for the full 90
days, or until the security list members release you from the confidentiality,
whichever comes first, as we
[coordinate disclosures](#coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure) with Knative
partners who may need some time after the vulnerability is addressed in Knative
in order to update their systems.

### What's in a report?

Initial reports via email should include the limited information described
[above](#reporting-a-vulnerability). Followup details should include a
description of the vulnerability, a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating the
vulnerability, and a statement of what this vulnerability puts at risk. Please
send reports in English.

The security list members may make a best-effort attempt to address reports that
do not meet these standards.

### Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

Knative Security engages with partners, including some vendors of
[Knative-based offerings](https://knative.dev/docs/knative-offerings/), to
coordinate disclosure of newly discovered vulnerabilities.

If you believe your organization should participate in Knative's Coordinated
Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process, please contact Knative Security to
discuss this.

#### Dependencies

From time to time, Knative dependencies may have their own vulnerabilities.
Those coordinating the response to and disclosure of those vulnerabilities are
encouraged to reach out to Knative Security through our
[Official Channels](#reporting-a-vulnerability) so that any Knative and Knative
partners can also respond promptly.

#### Background

For more general information on CVD, please review the information provided in
the following links:

[Guidelines and Practices for Multi-Party Vulnerability Coordination and Disclosure](https://www.first.org/global/sigs/vulnerability-coordination/multiparty/FIRST-Multiparty-Vulnerability-Coordination-latest.pdf)

[The CERT Guide to Vulnerability Disclosure](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2017_003_001_503340.pdf)

[PSIRT Services Framework](https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/psirts/FIRST_PSIRT_Services_Framework_v1.0.pdf)

## Vulnerability Rewards

Knative itself has no bug bounty or vulnerability reward program (VRP), and no
formal relationship with any VRP.

Some Knative vulnerability reports may be eligible for rewards through programs
from other organizations, including those from vendors of
[Knative-based offerings](https://knative.dev/docs/knative-offerings/).
Reporters should comply with program rules to receive these rewards. The Knative
community will not submit reports for rewards on the reporter's behalf, and in
some cases may not be legally able to do so. Organizations that both participate
in our CVD and have a VRP may treat our vulnerability disclosure as a VRP
report, but are under no obligation from Knative to do so.

If you choose to report a vulnerability to a VRP, please ensure that they, or
you, also report it to us through our
[Official Channels](#reporting-a-vulnerability), _e.g.,_ as part of their
[coordinated vulnerability disclosure](#coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure).

No endorsement is made by Knative about any VRP, and no commentment is implied
by listing here that any VRP or vendor will offer rewards for any Knative
vulnerabilities.

### Specific VRPs

As of this writing, potentially relevant reward programs include:

- [Google](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/index.html)

_These lists are offered as a convenience only._ Please submit a PR to add
others.

## Questions

_Non-confidential_ questions and comments about this policy may be directed to
the [Knative Security Working Group](./working-groups/working-groups/#security);
_confidential_ ones, including whether specific issues are in scope, should be
raised through our [Official Channels](#reporting-a-vulnerability).
