I am currently working as the Working Group Co-Lead for the [Knative Functions WG](https://github.com/knative/func) and was involved in the 1.0 relase for Knative. 
I've done contributions to Knative Eventing, Knative Functions and conformance testing in the past. 
I've contributed with other Open Source and CNCF projects such as [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io), [VCluster](https://vcluster.com), [Tekton](https://tekton.dev), [CDEvents](https://cdevents.dev/),  [Spring Cloud](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) and [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) among others. 
I am also involved with foundations like the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) and [OpenUK](https://openuk.uk/) withe main goal of bringing people together to collaborate.

I am running for a Steering committee seat because I am passionate about Knative and how it can be integrated with other tools in the CNCF ecosystem. 
I am a strong believer in the project and would like to raise its awareness. 
One way is by connecting with adjacent OSS communities and ensuring end users can leverage them together to solve larger problems.
I've participated in building integrations with other communities ([VCluster Knative Serving Plugin](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-plugins/tree/master/knative-plugin) and [Knative Functions Spring Boot Support](https://github.com/knative/func/tree/main/templates/springboot)), but being part of the steering committee can enable me to bring 
people together under initiatives that are valuable for Knative as a whole.
