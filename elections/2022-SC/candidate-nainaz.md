Here's a paragraph about my contributions to Knative.
I joined the Knative community over a year ago and my contributions have been varied and of different kind than what can be recognized through GitHub.  
I started by joining the Trademark committee and worked towards disassociating conformance from the 1.0 release, making Release 1.0 meet its deadline. 
I worked on creating Knative Eventing Conformance tasks and collecting them. 
Tasks related to CNCF donation. 
Worked with Lance to do the Knative Functions(boson)  donation to Knative community. 
Worked with Omer to do the first round of Function User interviews to define Roadmap.
 I have also been working with the Security Working Group to bring requirements and help provide business context for Security related tasks. For example, All hops are encrypted in Knative and PCI-DSS requirements and currently working on Knative Eventing Security
Worked with others to provide  business context and push for the longer Knative release. 
Bringing Multi-Tenancy requirements to Knative Serving and Eventing.
 I was also part of the Program Committee for KnativeCon Europe and KnativeCon NA. 
Co-event chair for KnativeCon NA.
I am also  an active member of the DUX working group and as part of this assisted in the User Interviews . 
Hopefully this provide enough context about my participation in the Knative community. 

Here's a paragraph about why I'm running.
I am running for Steering Committee, as I think that Knative belongs on every Kubernetes out there, for bringing serverless capabilities to every Kube platform and we need to make that happen by expanding it with Security, Multi-tenancy. API etc.
 I also believe that Event Driven is the present and future for connecting all the various pieces and components of users' applications across on-prem and cloud and we need to make the installation and use of this piece more frictionless to realize this goal. 
With the addition of Functions, we are elevating Knative even more and developer experience with Functions and Eventing is going to be crucial for the coming years. 

I hope to become a part of the team that will materialize this by working with the community, our contributes and our end users.
