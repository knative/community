Hey everyone. I'm a current TOC member and Serving Lead. I've been contributing 
to the project (in many of it's areas) since 2017 - before it was called Knative. 

With the CNCF donation we're at an exciting step in the project's journey. I'm seeing
more engagement from end-users and new contributors. This year I hope to support 
existing WG leads and to help new contributors onboard onto the project.
