Hi, I am Zbynek Roubalik (ZbynÄ›k RoubalÃ­k if you fancy Czech diacritics). My main focus have been around Functions on Knative,
ie. some initial not so successful attempts, then Boson project, that later became Knative Sandbox project (`func` kn plugin)
and is now on it's way to become a full-fledged Working Group, yay!
The other area of my interest is around KEDA & Knative integration, which initally enabled autoscaling of a few Eventing Sources
and has a great potential to be expanded even more. This really makes even the Knative infrastructure serverless.

I think that I am able to openly to listen to other peoples thoughts/ideas and I'd define myself as result driven - I just love seeing getting things done.
I am also a maintainer of another CNCF project - KEDA, which is fairly smaller in comparison to Knative,
though I think that I can bring some inputs and ideas from this area (and a little bit different user community) as well.
I think that Knative is a great project and we all should focus on making it even more accessible for new users and potential contributors.
The internal technical goodies of any project are great, though I think that aeveloper accessibility and usability is a key area.

And yes, I think that this Steve's quote is valid more than ever ðŸ˜ƒ
