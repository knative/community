I have been working on the Knative project in various areas for two years now.
I spend my time on Knative Serving but also on cross-cutting concerns like observability, networking etc.
I am also interested in making users successful with Knative thus I have contributed in different aspects such as
debugging issues, reviewing PRs, adding documentation and features.

I would like to see the project becoming even more successful and I am interested a lot in helping
to that direction. I feel there is space for improvement for the many sub-projects we maintain to make Knative the best
solution for Cloud Native application development.
