Y Meadows has used Knative since its founding to provide process workflow
services to its customers. We run hundreds of different KServices, and lean
heavily on Knative's ability to scale to zero and to queue and forward messages
to our applications. As the Y Meadows lead of DevOps, I've spent the last few
years operating and maintaining our Knative deployment, and considering how it
fits into our technical stack.

As a software and operations engineer with more than 20 years in the field, I'd
be able to lend my experience and judgement as the End User on the Steering
Committee. My organization has a critical interest in the health and
strength of the project, so I'm motivated to help out. I also believe that our
use cases may be motivational and that they'd align with the vision of the
Knative project.
