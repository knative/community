# 2025 Knative Steering Committee End User Seat

## Purpose

This document describes the process for filling the end user Representative
for Knative Steering Committee. The newly appointed representative will serve a
one (1) year term.

## Background

In 2021 we introduced one end user seat to bring more diversity into the SC
representation which is to be elected by the SC once the SC election was
completed.

## Eligibility

In order to be considered for end user seat, the company the user is
representing must be listed in the [Adopters](../../ADOPTERS.MD) file.

## Schedule

The one year term would be from February 19, 2025 to until a new representative is chosen in January 2026.
