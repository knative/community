# 2025 Knative Steering Committee End User Seat

## Purpose

for Knative Steering Committee. The newly appointed representative will serve a
one (1) year term.

representing must be listed in the [Adopters](../../ADOPTERS.MD) file.

## Schedule

| February 19 | Announcement of selection                               |

The one year term would be from February 19, 2025 to until a new representative is chosen in January 2026.
