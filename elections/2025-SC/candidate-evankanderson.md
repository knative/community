I have been a long time member of the Knative community, serving on the both
the TOC and Steering Committee and organizing some activities behind the scenes.
I've worked on most areas of the project, and helped write a number of the
governance documents, as well as helping to push for the donation of Knative to
the CNCF in 2021 and 2022.  I've also spoken a number of times about Knative,
and have contributed to many of the areas of the project at one time or another.

I'm interested in serving on the Steering Committee because I'd like to be able
to officially leverage my contacts and experience with the Cloud-Native
community to better stitch Knative into the overall Cloud-Native application
platform, and to continue to support the project.

In addition to my work on Knative, I'm a current maintainer of OpenSSF Minder, a
member of CNCF TAG-Security, and a participant in the OpenSSF Baseline project.
