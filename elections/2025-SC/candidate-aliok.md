I have been part of the Knative community since 2019 and have been contributing to the project since then. 
I served as a Steering Committee (SC) member from 2023 to 2025 and here are some of the activities:
- Kick-started the graduation process of Knative
- Participated in graduation related activities such as writing the graduation proposal, preparing the materials for CNCF TOC, etc.
- Participated in making the community and governance changes for the graduation
- Helped with UX working group activities
- Helped with mentoring programs such as GSoC and LFX Mentorship
- Participated in various SC discussions and decisions to help the project move forward

Similar to last SC election, I am running for SC because I think Knative is a great project and I would like to continue helping Knative to grow 
its community and to make it a better project for its users and contributors. Doing these activities as an SC member will help me to be more effective.
