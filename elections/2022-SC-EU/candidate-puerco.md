I would like to nominate myself as a representative of my
organization for the Knative end user seat. My name is Adolfo García Veytia, a
software engineer with Chainguard. I usually go by @puerco on all slacks and
the Internet. While I have done just a few comments on Knative PRs, I am an
active open source contributor on many projects. I am an active member of the
Kubernetes community, where I am one of the
[SIG Release Technical Leads](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-release/README.md#technical-leads) and a Release Manager. I have contributed in the past to other cloud native
projects and Sigstore. I was a recipient of the
[Chop Wood, Carry Water](https://github.com/cncf/awards#chop-wood-carry-water)
community awards in 2022. I am also a member of the SPDX community.

Chainguard is an open source first company. Our company employs several
contributors of Knative and we also depend heavily on the project for our
products and services. I feel that the open source focus of Chainguard, our
comprehensive use of Knative and the  numerous contributors we employ in the
company make us an ideal candidate for the End User seat.

I am really excited at the prospect of serving as a relay between the project
and the user community, especially given the great feedback that Chainguard
can provide.
