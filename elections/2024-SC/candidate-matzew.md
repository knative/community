I am a long standing contributor to Knative, since 2018. I have been involved in the Eventing project nearly since its beginning. I was WG lead before and have contributed a lot of code to Knative at large, and especially Knative Eventing subprojects. In Knative eventing I am one of the top three contributors.

I am running because I deeply care for the project and feel SC is place where I can help Knative community to grow further and improve its community.
