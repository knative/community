Hi. My name is Julian (@julz) üëã. I've made various contributions across
Knative such as the Domain Mapping feature in serving API working group, Scale
Down Delay in Autoscaling WG, RewriteHost in Networking and the new prototype
Knative website for Docs/UX WGs. I try my best to chop wood and carry water
for the project, and as well as bigger features I have contributed a lot of
cleanups and reviews. I‚Äôve also made some interesting extensions to Knative,
such as Freeze Proxy. I‚Äôm especially interested in how we can make Knative
the de-facto standard for FaaS/PaaS/eventy workloads, both in private
clusters and for public clouds, and in this context co-founded (and am
co-leading) the Security WG.

I‚Äôm running for the TOC because I‚Äôd like to pitch in towards making Knative -
and the Knative technical community - bigger, broader, and better. Being a
relatively new contributor (but not too new! I have been contributing heavily
for well over a year and am an approver/lead in 3 WGs) means I'll bring a fresh
perspective, as well as recent experience of going through the contributor
ladder, to the TOC. My priorities are helping us build and grow the technical
community (by making it easier to get started and contribute - including
extensions, by clarifying the path to approver and lead, and by streamlining
feature proposal) and helping us to drive down the time to the ‚Äúthis is
obviously better‚Äù moment for users trying to use Knative.
