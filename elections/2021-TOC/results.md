## 2021 TOC Member Election Results

Thank you to everyone who took the time to vote in the Technical 
Oversight Committee (TOC) election! 

We are happy to announce that Julian Friedman (aka Julz), David Protasowski,
and Evan Anderson are our newly elected [TOC members](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md)
for 2021. Please take a moment to congratulate them.

Both Julz and Evan will serve 2 year terms while David will serve the remainder
of Grantâ€™s term ending in 2022, since Grant recently 
[stepped down from the TOC](https://groups.google.com/g/knative-dev/c/o9mk87tS4zU/m/hamAENH_AgAJ).

Cheers,
Dawn Foster and Josh Berkus
TOC Election Officers
