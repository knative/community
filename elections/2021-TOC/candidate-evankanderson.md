I've been a member of the Knative community since its inception, working on both the Serving and Eventing components. I worked on the initial serving spec and requirements for non-Istio ingresses and on the initial eventing documentation. Since then, I've worked on most areas of the project, including docs and the website, the operator, knative-sandbox, governance, automation, and working group organization.

I'm running for TOC because I'm happy with the community we've built here and I'm looking forward to making Knative even more successful over the next two years.
