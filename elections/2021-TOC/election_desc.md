## Election Officers

In an effort to run a fair and transparent election, the following people
have been asked by the Steering Committee to run this election:

- [Josh Berkus](https://github.com/jberkus)
- [Dawn Foster](https://github.com/geekygirldawn)

You can reach us by emailing elections@knative.team

## Candidacy Process

**Nomination**

If you want to stand for election, open a PR against the
[knative/community repository](https://github.com/knative/community) to include
your candidate profile in the `/elections/2021-TOC` folder, with the following
filename format:

```
candidate-yourname.md
```

We have included a template file as an example. This profile should include:

* Your name
* Your company affiliation (employer or otherwise)
* Your contributions to Knative
* Why you are running

You can find [examples from the past SC elections](https://github.com/knative/community/tree/main/elections/2020/SC),
although the format there was different due to using CIVS for elections rather than Elekto.

Once you have created the PR, you may email knative-dev and/or knative-users *once* to let
people know about your candidacy and encourage endorsements as comments on the PR.
Please use something like for your email in order to encourage endorsements
in Github and not on the mailing list:

```
Fellow Knative community members,

My name is {your name} and I am running for TOC.  You can read
my profile here: {link to PR}.  If you support my candidacy, please endorse me
by commenting on that PR.  Please don't reply to endorse me on this list.
```

After a candidate has met all election requirements, the Election Officers will
merge the profile PR.

If you want to nominate someone else, you may do so, but PLEASE talk to them
first.

**Campaigning**

Please refer to the [TOC Election Charter] and understand
that we care deeply about [limiting corporate campaigning]. The election
officers and members of the steering committee [pledge to recuse] themselves
from any form of electioneering.

You should be running as a "brand free" individual, based on your contribution
to the project as a member of this community, outside of whatever corporate
roles you may hold.

## Voting Process

Elections will be held using [elekto](https://elekto.io/). More 
details on the process are coming soon.

Employer diversity is encouraged, and thus maximal representation will be
enforced as spelled out in the [TOC Election Charter].

### Decision

The newly elected body will be announced on the [Knative Blog] on May 13, 2020.
