# 2021 Voters Guide - Knative TOC Election

The role of this election is to fill the two (2) seats due for election this year on the [Knative Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/master/TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md). The elected members will serve two (2) year terms.

This election will shape the future of Knative as a community and project.
While WGs help shape the individual direction of the project, the
TOC Charter covers the technical direction, health of the project
and community as a whole.

This is a brief summary of the election; for more details, such as how to become a candidate, [see the README](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/elections/2021-TOC/README.md).
