## Why You're Running for SC (max 300 words)

I have spent most of my career trying to build tools that make folks’ lives
easier, faster, stronger and better. Knative was one attempt at that, there have
been others. I have a strong desire to make Knative be a healthy, fun and
thriving community, where we can have fun, grow together and learn from each
other.

In addition to having a healthy, vibrant community, I want to make the project
be successful by solving real world computing needs. We’re very early in the
journey, I care very deeply about this project and I would love to be able to
continue contributing to shaping the vision, as well as keep on chopping water
and carrying wood on the technical side.
