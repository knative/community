## Why You're Running for SC (max 300 words)

At a young age, I fell in love with chopping water and carrying wood by keeping the sauna hot and its water bucket full.  A lot of my inspiration to run (and campaign strategy) comes from Kanye's 2020 presidential run (which I know nothing about, but it seems rock solid).  This is obviously parody, written by my number one fan / campaign manager: @mattmoor, who takes full responsibility for the material contained here until it can be replaced with something a bit less "fake news".
