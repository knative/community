## Why I'm running for Steering Committee

By volume, Knative's leadership needs are overwhelmingly technical: we need
capable and empathetic workgroup leads and TOC members. But some fraction
of the community's effort has to be about the community's own continuity
and smooth, healthy functioning.

I think I'm suited to that latter role. Not as a technical leader, but as
a non-technical servant to the community. I have previous experience
working in committee systems where the stakes were high. I believe I can
bring that experience to bear in allowing the community to focus on
building Knative in the best tool, experience and community it can be.
