## Why You're Running for SC (max 300 words)

I joined the Kubernetes ecosystem couple months after it started and contributed several projects (e.g kompose, cabin), I started the kubeless project as one of the first FaaS solution on k8s. When Knative was announced in July 2018 I was happy to take part in the announcement and decided to launch a new startup TriggerMesh to push the serverless mindset on top of k8s.

The last year I have been less active in Knative as we/triggermesh developed our product internally. We do contribute as the maintainer of the GitLab source and developers and maintainers of other sources (e.g AWS, ZenDesk, Slack...) and we regularly file issues and provide fixes when we find problems operating Knative. Personally, I seldom code these days and my time is much better spent as a product manager, tester, podcaster etc. Which is why my personal contributions in Knative are mostly around docs and issues, meaning that you most likely will never see a Go PR from me.

Now that the governance of the project seems a bit more clear I would welcome the opportunity to represent the smaller companies and independent contributors to the project as well as offer a non US-centric view. The community will thrive only if the "little guys" feel that they can join, contribute and that their contributions are valued as more than pure Q/A or input to a roadmap. Over the last six years since Kubernetes started I have gotten to know a lot of the members of the "container" community at large, across companies and my stint as a Apache CloudStack vice-president prior to that should be helpful in helping shape and grow the project.
