I have been part of the Knative community since 2019 and have been contributing to the project since then. 
I have been an approver in many working groups such as Eventing, Operations and also some emeritus working groups like Eventing Kafka, Eventing Sources and Event Delivery.

I have implemented numerous features in Knative, on most layers and modules of the project.

Besides technical contributions, I have been helping the Knative Steering Committee with driving 
the graduation of Knative in CNCF, being an election officer, and various other tasks. 

In addition to Knative, I am an active contributor to CNCF TAG Contributor Strategy, where I am a tech lead and a governance working group member. 
I help projects to grow their contributor base, have a better governance and community structure.
Of course, these contributions help me a lot to learn how to have a healthy community and project.
I have been already using those learnings in Knative and I believe I have made a positive impact with
my interactions with the community and the SC.
I would like to continue doing so.

Similarly, I am a very active member of CNCF's mentoring programs. I am a co-admin in Google Summer of Code and LFX Mentorship programs for CNCF.
I have been marketing these programs in Knative to grow our community.

Lastly, I am helping out the UX Working Group members to make Knative more user-friendly.

Being a CNCF Ambassador also helps with spreading the word about Knative and growing our community. I use the opportunities I get to talk about Knative.

I am running for SC because I think Knative is a great project and I would like to continue helping Knative to grow 
its community and to make it a better project for its users and contributors. Doing these activities as a SC member will help me to be more effective.
