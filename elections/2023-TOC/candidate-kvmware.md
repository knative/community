Hello!
I along with a few brave others are the little gnomes that keep the knative project running. I have been a lead on Productivity ever since Chi Zhang left. We try to make the whole contributor process as easy as possible. Productivity maintains the infrastructure across all projects and I think we are well informed of Knative as a whole and can relate with working group leads more because our hands are in all the projects.

Productivity has gone through quite a transformation since my involvement. We have more contributors than before (was just Chi and I), a git ops backed infra (before lots of manual tweaking/bookkeeping), and currently going through a change to make our tools easier to reuse internally and for other OSS projects. I believe that I can use my experience to further help support all of the Knative projects beyond just the infrastructure and I am excited to see what we all can do these coming years together!
