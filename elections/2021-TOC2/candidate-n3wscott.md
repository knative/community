I have been with Knative since initial public launch. In that time I have been
leading the Sources working group, as well as picking up leading the
Productivity working group at in Nov 2020. I spend a lot of time in Eventing,
but I was also a key member on a lot of the reconciler framework and generator
code we use in and around Knative. When I am not in Knative, I am working on
CloudEvents as a contributor to that spec as well as one of the maintainers of
the CloudEvents golang sdk; which is heavily used by Knative Eventing and
Sources.

I care deeply about the direction and future of Knative as a project. I believe
we have built the start of something that will change how developers and vendors
think about building solutions for the cloud native space, and more importantly
how those solutions remain portable between vendors and technologies. I see
there is room to grow and I would love (continue) being a voice of technical
direction for the project.
