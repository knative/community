# 2021 Voters Guide - Knative TOC Special Election

This election will shape the future of Knative as a community and project.
While WGs help shape the individual direction of the project, the
TOC Charter covers the technical direction, health of the project
and community as a whole.

This special election has 2 goals:
- **Runoff election**
  - For the 2021 TOC election, we had a tie for one of the 2 TOC seats. This runoff election
    is designed to fill the remaining seat due for election this year on the
    Knative Technical Oversight Committee.
  - This runoff is between David Protasowski and Scott Nichols.
  - **Selection Criteria**: Out of these 2 candidates, the most preferred candidate in this 
    special election will serve a two (2) year term.
- **Filling a new vacancy**
  - We also need to replace Grant Rodgers who recently stepped down from the TOC, so we have an additional
    seat that needs to be filled with someone who will serve the remainder
    of his term ending during the 2022 election.
  - This vacancy could not be filled using candidates from the previous election because after filling the above
    seat in the runoff election, VMware and Red Hat / IBM will be at the
    maximum number of seats (2)
    held by employees from the same organization (or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning
    each other).
  - This means that we need to have at least one (preferably more) nominee who does not
    work at Red Hat, IBM, or VMware.
  - **Selection Criteria**: The most preferred candidate who would not put any single employer over  
    the 2 employee maximum will serve the remainder of Grant's term ending during the 2022 election.

Please rank all candidates together according to your preference and evaluation of them as potential TOC members, regardless of company affiliation. The candidates for the two seats will be selected by the SC, according to the total preference rankings and TOC eligibility rules.

This is a brief summary of the election; for more details, such as how to become a candidate, [see the README](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/elections/2021-TOC2/README.md).
