# 2021 Voters Guide - Knative TOC Special Election

This special election has 2 goals:
- **Runoff election** for the remaining seat due for election this year on the 
  Knative Technical Oversight Committee. This runoff is between 
  David Protasowski and Scott Nichols. The one with the most votes in this special
  election will serve a two (2) year term.
- **Filling the vacancy** to replace Grant Rodgers who recently stepped down and serve the remainder
  of his term ending during the 2022 election. This vacancy could not be filled using 
  candidates from the previous election because after filling the above
  seat, VMware and Red Hat / IBM will be at the 
  [maximum number of seats](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/mechanics/TOC.md) (2) 
  held by employees from the same organization (or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning
  each other). This means that we need to have at least one (preferably more) nominee who does not 
  work at Red Hat, IBM, or VMware. 

This election will shape the future of Knative as a community and project.
While WGs help shape the individual direction of the project, the
TOC Charter covers the technical direction, health of the project
and community as a whole.

This is a brief summary of the election; for more details, such as how to become a candidate, [see the README](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/elections/2021-TOC2/README.md).
