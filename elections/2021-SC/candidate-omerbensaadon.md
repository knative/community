## Why I'm Running
This is an *extremely* exciting time to be involved with Knative. I would argue that the community is healthier and more aligned than it ever has been, and our best days are ahead of us.

If I may wax poetic for a second: what is the point of a Steering Committee, really? The way I see it, Steering is responsible for...
- Establishing community norms and values (what is and isn't OK in the eyes of the community?)
- Connecting end-users with the community at large (who does this community serve?)
- General community leadership (who do we trust to resolve things when things go wrong? Are unclear?)

I feel I have done my part to earn the trust of the many stellar members of this community and can effectively play these roles.

I also feel I bring proven experience to the table, with chops in developer experience, product thinking, marketing and effectively organizing contributors towards a share goal. Skillsets which I would argue are somewhat rare in the Knative Community.

On top of the above responsibilities, since I am going to be working at Github on Github Projects, I plan to participate in roadmap planning where I can (functionally dog-fooding my own product while contributing to Knative). Also, happy to take feature requests ðŸ˜‰.

I sincerely hope the members of the Knative community consider me a friend, a trusted ally and an effective leader in this community; regardless of who pays my salary.
