## 2021 SC Election Results

We are happy to announce that Carlos Santana and Lance Ball are our newly elected Steering Committee members with both serving a 2-year term. They will serve together with continuing Steering members Paul Morie and Ville Aikas.  Please take a moment to congratulate them!

The competition was fierce with 6 very strong candidates to choose from, so thank you to everyone who ran in this election and everyone who took the time to cast your ballot!

As announced earlier this week as part of [Knativeâ€™s application](https://knative.dev/blog/steering/knative-cncf-donation/ ) to become a CNCF incubating project, April Nassi will remain on the Steering Committee for one more year to help coordinate the transition of infrastructure and ensure a smooth process to bring Knative into the CNCF.

We thank Michael Behrendt for his service on the committee.

In this election, 49 ballots were cast out of 94 eligible voters (52%).  Four exceptions were requested and none were denied.

Cheers,
Dawn Foster and Josh Berkus
SC Election Officers
