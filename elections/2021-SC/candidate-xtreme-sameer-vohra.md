## Contributions
I joined the Knative community over a year ago and got started as an individual contributor in the Eventing space (issues, PRs, test coverage).

Since then, I have contributed across the project around
- docs
- v1.0
- discovery

In my current role, I
- grew the community (engaged end users and contributors, grew the OSS team at my organization by 7 engineers)
- enabled folks (onboarding, pairing, hosted the new contributor retro)


## Why I'm Running
Knative has an awesome community vibe and amazing technology. Knative is what I wish I had when I was an application developer.
Looking towards the future, our focus must remain on
- contributors
- end users

I am passionate about enabling and growing both.
 
For contributors, we need to reduce the friction to contribute and leverage the deep technical expertise in our community to attract and retain new contributors.  Prior to being a people manager, I was a developer for 10yrs, ~6 yrs of which were working on various open source projects. I deeply care about fostering a happy healthy community and shortening feedback loops. Initially, I'd focus my efforts on improving the experience for current contributors and then look to grow the contributor group by engaging other companies leveraging Knative.
 
For end users, Knative provides tremendous value. We need to keep raising its awareness and helping users leverage it. I have spent the last 7 years working in the developer tools/platform space (Knative, Concourse CI, CloudFoundry, BOSH) and believe that Knative is just getting started. With 1.0, the project is set up for substantial growth in adoption and weâ€™re just entering its most exciting phase.
 
I feel privileged to be part of the Knative community and would love the opportunity to do more to serve the community.
