## Why I'm Running for SC

At Optum, I have been instrumental in adopting Knative at an early stage and making it into a preferred 
platform for developers to deploy apps. We were able to achieve this by consistently 
engaging with the Knative community, sharing our feedback and raising issues/pull requests. 

Knative has just become GA and has a long way to go. I want to be part of this journey and provide 
an end user perspective to the future road maps and encourage more active participation of end users.
