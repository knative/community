## Why I'm Running for SC

With all the recent changes in the project I want to see it find a second wind, grow and establish a vibrant user community. I have past experience as VP of Apache CloudStack and founder of kompose, kubeless and kabin which were contributed to Kubernetes ecosystem.

I have always seen Knative as the only viable solution for a long term serverless solution on Kubernetes and gave up my own project Kubeless in favor of Knative. We need to balance the technical vision of the project with the real needs of the users to tackle practical issues in building event-driven systems and what I call a light weight PaaS.

Finally, I think it is time for the project to align itself with the Cloud-Native community at large with a move to CNCF so that we can collaborate with more confidence and feeling of openness with our peers in other projects.
