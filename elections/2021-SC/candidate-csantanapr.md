## Why I'm Running for SC

I want to contribute my time, energy, and passion on growing a healthy community for Knative.

I have past open-source experienced as a core committer and PMC member for Apache Cordova, and Apache OpenWhisk. We have an excellent core of technical contributors, and I want to showcase their work and grow awareness that Knative is a great project to get involved and welcome everyone with open arms doesn't matter at what stage they are in their Cloud Native journey.

With Knative we are in a position to help a large audience that are getting started on understanding what's all this serverless, containers, distributing system, and event driven applications is all about on top of Kubernetes.

I will work on restarting the discussion again for Knative to be donated to CNCF to be more align with Kubernetes community.
