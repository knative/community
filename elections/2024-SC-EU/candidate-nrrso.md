## Contributions to Knative
- I gave a session at KubeCon North America with other end users on "Real-World Knative: Success Stories from Production Environments" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DN7LQCn7aU)
- Provided a CNCF case study on "How SVA used Knative to kickstart cloud native adoption and patterns" (https://www.cncf.io/case-studies/system-vertrieb-alexander-gmbh/)



## Why I'm running.

At SVA, I work as a Solution Architect serving Public Sector clients, specifically in regards to cloud-native Development and the Design of bespoke on-premise Private Clouds.
A big hurdle for established Public Sector organizations in moving to a more loosely-coupled, more agile software architecture is coping with the complexities of smaller services, new technologies, and service integration. Knative, through its well-defined interfaces, lets us hide a lot of those complexities and standardize how business units write, deploy, secure, integrate, and monitor their systems.
In 2021, we took a bet with Knative as the foundation of our unified on-prem AppDev and Integration-Plattform for our clients and have had phenomenal success with it so far.
I am really excited at the prospect of serving as a relay between the project and the user community. I specifically look forward to contributing with my unique perspective in the following domains:

- Knative documentation
- Knative observability tooling
- Knative requirements for deployments in restrictive/classified environments
