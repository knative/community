## Objectives

The objectives of project social media are:

- Share project news, roadmap updates, news releases.
- Report on performance and security updates.
- Educate on project updates.
- Share information on how-tos, demos, etc. that are valuable to the community.
- Build awareness for the project.
- Drive engagement and participate in the project.

## Strategy and Guidelines

### Strategy

- Keep messages positive and uplifting, consistent with the values and principles of CNCF.
- Communicate big picture ideas vs “announcements” or news. News will be positioned less like an announcement and more around what it means.
- Share content across social media channels that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.
- Maintain a balance of posting on CNCF activities/news and ecosystem-focused content.
- Share vendor-neutral, community-sourced posts that are informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused.
- Engage with the community through retweets and sharing of community content.

### General Guidelines

For all CNCF social activity, we remain a neutral foundation. Examples of the type of content:

- Owned content is CNCF news, blogs, case studies, survey data, etc.
- Project content is anything sourced from CNCF’s currently hosted projects, including project news, roadmap updates, new releases, performance/security updates, blogs, conferences slides/videos, etc.
- Ecosystem content is vendor-neutral and project-impartial sourced from contributors, maintainers, ambassadors, news outlets, etc., including blog posts, news coverage, thought leadership bylines, technology demos, sketch notes, GitHub work, cloud native-specific Meetups, etc.
- CNCF is not able to share anything on our channels that promotes a vendor product or directs to a company website.
- Social posts from member company handles and/or vendor channels cannot be shared.
- RTs are limited to news outlet handles, @linuxfoundation, @kubecon_, project handles + personal handles.
- Community content that abides by the channel guidelines + includes insight from/work with more than one CNCF project will be prioritized for sharing.
- Activities that are hosted by and open to the public can be promoted, as they benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

### Images & Videos

Images shared, unless specifically credited back to a community member, will meet the requirements of “free for commercial use” and “no attribution required.”

### Hashtags

CNCF and Knative uses hashtags in our posts:

- To measure the success of campaigns (for example, #KubeCon).
- To expand our reach beyond our current followers and tap into larger, trending topics on Twitter (for example, #cloudnative).
- To organize or categorize shares (for example, #Kubernetes).
- Add #knative hashtag to posts if possible.

### To request content to be shared

Share your tweet on the #knative-socialmedia channel on the CNCF Slack channel.
