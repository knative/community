# Knative Social Media Guidelines

This document covers the social media guidelines for the use of the Knative social media channels.

**Knative Project Twitter/X handle:**
- [@KnativeProject](https://x.com/KnativeProject)

**LinkedIn company page:**
- [Knative](https://www.linkedin.com/company/knative/)

## Objectives

The objectives of project social media are:

- Share project news, roadmap updates, news releases.
- Report on performance and security updates.
- Educate on project updates.
- Share information on how-tos, demos, etc. that are valuable to the community.
- Build awareness for the project.
- Drive engagement and participate in the project.

## Strategy and Guidelines

### Strategy

- Keep messages positive and uplifting, consistent with the [values and principles of CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/charter.md).
- Communicate big picture ideas vs "announcements" or news. News will be positioned less like an announcement and more around what it means.
- Share content across social media channels that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.
- Maintain a balance of posting on CNCF activities/news and ecosystem-focused content.
- Share [vendor-neutral](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/), community-sourced posts that are informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused.
- Engage with the community through reposts and sharing of community content.

### General Guidelines

For all CNCF social activity, we remain a neutral foundation, in compliance with [CNCF's vendor neutrality principles](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/).
Examples of the type of content:

- Owned content is CNCF news, blogs, case studies, survey data, etc.
- Project content is anything sourced from CNCF's currently hosted projects, including project news, roadmap updates, new releases, performance/security updates, blogs, conferences slides/videos, etc.
- Ecosystem content is vendor-neutral and project-impartial sourced from contributors, maintainers, ambassadors, news outlets, etc., including blog posts, news coverage, thought leadership bylines, technology demos, sketch notes, GitHub work, cloud native-specific meetups, etc.
- CNCF is not able to share anything on our channels that promotes a vendor product or directs to a company website.
- Social posts from member company handles and/or vendor channels cannot be shared.
- Reposts are limited to news outlet handles such as [@linuxfoundation](https://twitter.com/linuxfoundation), [@kubecon_](https://twitter.com/kubecon_), project handles, personal handles and their counterparts in other social media platforms.
- Community content that abides by the channel guidelines + includes insight from/work with more than one CNCF project will be prioritized for sharing.
- Activities that are hosted by and open to the public can be promoted, as they benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

### Images & Videos

Images shared, unless specifically credited back to a community member, will meet the requirements of "free for commercial use" and "no attribution required."

### Hashtags

CNCF and Knative uses hashtags in our posts:

- To measure the success of campaigns (for example, #KubeCon).
- To expand our reach beyond our current followers and tap into larger, trending topics on Twitter (for example, #cloudnative).
- To organize or categorize shares (for example, #Kubernetes).
- Add #knative hashtag to posts if possible.

### To request content to be shared

Share your social media post on the [#knative-socialmedia](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C05R3575M9U) channel on the CNCF Slack.

## Regular posts

### New contributor celebration

Every month, we celebrate new contributors to the Knative project. We will share a post on Twitter and LinkedIn to celebrate the new contributors.
See the [Knative contributor data](https://github.com/aliok/knative-contrib-report?tab=readme-ov-file#list-of-all-contributors-to-the-knative-project-2) for more information on how to find new contributors.

### Biweekly social media post

After each Knative Steering Committee meeting, we will share a post on Twitter and LinkedIn to share the highlights of the past 2 weeks.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Steering Committee

Steering Committee members have access to the Knative Twitter account and LinkedIn page.
They are responsible for approving posts and sharing content coming from Steering Committee members,
the social media manager, and the community.

Steering Committee members are responsible for monitoring the Knative social media channels and responding to messages and comments.

### Social Media Manager

The social media manager is responsible for creating and scheduling posts on the Knative Twitter account and LinkedIn page.
Knative Steering Committee members will approve the posts before they are published.

Steering Committee will not initially give access to the Knative Twitter account and LinkedIn page to the social media manager candidate.
After seeing consistent quality content, the candidate will be promoted to social media manager and will be given access to the Knative Twitter account and LinkedIn page.
They will be responsible for creating and scheduling posts as well as monitoring the channels. 

### Community

Community members can share their content on the [#knative-socialmedia](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C05R3575M9U) channel on the CNCF Slack, asking for reposts
on the official Knative social media channels.

## Visuals

All the social media visuals prepared will be stored in Knative UX team's Canva account, to be able to reuse them.
Using Canva's sharing feature, UX team can share the designs with the social media manager or any social media manager candidate.
