# Knative Release Schedule

Knative releases every 6 weeks. As much as possible, releases should be driven by automation, and repos should be ready to release at any point. It should also be possible to produce and consume nightly artifacts.

With that said, it can be useful to have a list of when future releases will happen, so this document provides a schedule for the next 6+ months of releases.
