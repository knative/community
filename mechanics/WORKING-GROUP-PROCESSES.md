## Why working groups?

Knative working groups are organizations responsible for the design and
implementation of large architectural aspects of the overall Knative project.
Working groups operate with a fair amount of autonomy within the broader scope
of the project. They tend to be long-lived, representing major initiatives over
Knative’s lifetime.

Some working groups focus on specific technologies. Other working groups are
cross-cutting in nature.

The technical oversight committee is responsible for the Knative project as a
whole. It sets the overall direction of the project, helps make crosscutting
architectural decisions, helps establish and dissolve working groups, and helps
ensure all working groups are generally rowing in the same direction

Although working groups are relatively lightweight structures, we want to keep
the number of working groups low in order to keep things manageable.

## Proposing a new working group

Generally, working groups should be founded once sufficient community interest
and discussion has occurred that there is general agreement that:

1. The problem space is interesting and is worth long-term investment by Knative

1. The problem is not well-covered by any of the existing chartered WGs

Note that "code dumps" are unlikely to be accepted as the beginning of a working
group, though they can be useful to start a conversation. For most topics that
meet the bar for a new WG, it's likely that other participants in the community
have ideas and opinions, and up-front conversations can help to focus the shape
and scope of the solution space.

The TOC and existing WGs should enable these conversations (e.g. setting up
one-off meetings, creating slack channels, etc). Once the community has
identified a substantial architectural area which would benefit from long-lived,
concerted and focused design, then you should consider creating a new working
group. To do so, you need to:

- **Create a charter**. This should be a few paragraphs explaining:

  - The mission of the working group

  - The goals of the working group (problems being solved)

  - The scope of the working group (topics, subsystems, code repos, areas of
    responsibility). Also include items which are out of scope. The TOC will be
    looking at this to make sure that there are appropriate touch-points and
    contracts between WGs when considering larger problems.

  Here are some example charters to help indicate the expected size of the
  document. The main things that the TOC will be looking for are:

  - [Event Delivery WG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SPnDRIJ6CGo5ElPGMWc25tX2iQfJfaiZwzBhruUZQw/edit)
  - [Eventing Sources WG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQo9DUbNdOIxf37eKSG1ULEyxydcG0YGeO13wBjQpEE/edit)
  - [Client WG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VtzDsWSTymHlG7boLUeaLg_0pSQvKibWK7xQxE3ihKs/edit)
  - [User Experience](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_LGymgqedAzRS0ACdVtJH1ktQxrf1OatfxzIb6LjU0/edit?usp=sharing)

  A typical WG charter is around 3 pages using and bulleted lists for goals,
  scope, and roadmap.

- **Nominate an initial set of leads**. The leads set the agenda for the working
  group and serve as final arbiters on any technical decision. See
  [below](#leads) for information on the responsibilities of leads and
  requirements for nominating them.

- **Prepare a Roadmap**. Create a preliminary 3 month roadmap for what the
  working group would focus on.

- **Send an Email**. Write up an email with your charter, nominated leads, and
  roadmap, and send it to
  [knative-tech-oversight@](mailto:knative-tech-oversight@googlegroups.com). The
  technical oversight committee will evaluate the request and decide whether the
  working group should be formed, whether it should be merely a subgroup of an
  existing working group, or whether it should be subsumed by an existing
  working group.

## Setting up a working group

Once approval has been granted by the technical oversight committee to form a
working group, the working group leads need to take a few steps to establish the
working group. _For an example of working group creation, see
[this issue](https://github.com/knative/community/issues/466)._

- **Create a Google Drive Folder**. Create a folder to hold your working group
  documents within this parent
  [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AM-QGZJ-HUA8Uk9PVA).
  Call your folder "GROUP_NAME".

- **Create a Meeting Notes Document**. Create a blank document in the above
  folder and call it "GROUP_NAME Group Meeting Notes".

- **Create a Roadmap Document**. Create a document in the above folder and call
  it "GROUP_NAME Group Roadmap". Put your initial roadmap in the document.

- **Schedule a Recurring Meeting**. Create a recurring meeting (weekly or
  bi-weekly, 30 or 60 minutes) on the
  [shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=knative.team_9q83bg07qs5b9rrslp5jor4l6s@group.calendar.google.com)
  and call the meeting "\$GROUP_NAME WG". Attach the meeting notes document to
  the calendar event. Generally schedule these meetings between 9:00AM to 2:59PM
  Pacific Time. Invite `knative-dev@googlegroups.com` Google group to the
  meeting, as well as necessary individual participants.

- **Register the Working Group**. Go to
  [WORKING-GROUPS.md](../working-groups/WORKING-GROUPS.md) and add your working
  group name, the names of the leads, the working group charter, and a link to
  the meeting you created.

- **Create Github Team using Peribolos**. Go to
  [peribolos/knative.md](../peribolos/knative.md), add your working
  group name under teams, and members. Grant access to relevant repositories for the working group.

- **Announce your Working Group**. Send a note to
  [knative-dev@](mailto:knative-dev@googlegroups.com),
  [knative-tech-oversight@](mailto:knative-tech-oversight@googlegroups.com), and
  [steering@](mailto:steering@knative.team) to
  announce your new working group. Include your charter in the email and provide
  links to the meeting invitation.

Congratulations, you now have a fully formed working group!

### Dissolving a working group

Some working groups are ephemeral or naturally reach the end of their useful
life. Working group leads can petition to dissolve their working groups by
emailing
[knative-tech-oversight@googlegroups.com](mailto:knative-tech-oversight@googlegroups.com).
The technical oversight committee takes ownership of any artifacts created or
owned by the dissolved working group. The technical oversight committee also
reserves the right to dissolve or recharter working groups over time as
necessary, though they will strive to first discuss this in committee meetings
and open community discussion.

## Leads

Each working group should have at least 2 leads, ideally 3, though young working
groups may have only 1 lead initially. Working groups should strive to include
representatives from multiple organizations as both leads and members. Working
group leads must be Members of the Knative project (that is, have made multiple
contributions to the project in the form of code, design, or documentation).

Please see the [Community Roles](../ROLES.md) document for a description of a
lead’s role and requirements.

## Running a working group

Leads are responsible for running a working group. Running the group involves a
few activities:

- **Meetings**. Prepare the agenda and run the regular working group meetings.
  Ensure the meetings are recorded, and properly archived.

- **Notes**. Ensure that meeting notes are kept up to date. Provide a link to
  the recorded meeting in the notes. The lead may delegate note-taking duties.

- **Decision Log**. Ensure that significant design decisions are captured in
  GitHub issues, Google Docs, or markdown files in the repo. It is recommended
  that Working Groups follow the [Feature Tracks](./FEATURE-TRACKS.md) process
  for design proposals. It's particularly important to focus on making it
  possible for new participants can find the history of decisions.

- **Roadmap**. Establish **and maintain** a roadmap for the working group
  outlining the areas of focus for the working group over the next 3 months.

- **Report**. Report current status to the main community meeting every 6 weeks.

### Be open

The community design process is done in the open. Working groups should
communicate primarily through the public working group meetings, through design
documents in the working group’s folder, through GitHub issues, and GitHub PRs.
Avoid private emails and/or meeting when possible.

### Making decisions

In general, working groups operate in a highly cooperative environment. Working
groups discuss designs in the open and take input from the community at large
when making technical choices. The working group leads are ultimately
responsible for setting the direction of the working group and making the tough
technical choices affecting the working group.

### Subgroups

Subgroups are ad hoc subteams within a working group with a special focus on a
set of problems or technologies. We don’t formalize processes for subgroups,
each working group can decide when subgroups are needed and how they operate.

### Escalations

Working groups can get blocked on specific technical disagreements. Leads are
expected to generally resolve such issues and allow work to progress.

Sometimes, different working groups can have conflicting goals or requirements.
Leads from all affected working groups generally work together and come to an
agreeable conclusion.

In all cases, remaining blocking issues can be raised to the
[technical oversight committee](./TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) to help resolve
the situation. To trigger an escalation, create an issue in the project's repo
and assign it to the **@knative/tech-oversight-committee** team.

The Steering Committee, as a last resort, provides the final escalation path for
any repository or working group issue that cannot be resolved by the TOC.
