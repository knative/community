This directory provides a location for documenting and recording common Knative
community practices. At the moment, these practices (except for the formation of
Working Groups) are recommendations which individual working groups may choose
to adopt, rather than requirements. Each working group should document their
processes; either in their own repo or in a pointer to these docs.

- [Working group formation and management](./WORKING-GROUP-PROCESSES.md)
- [Feature Tracks](./FEATURE-TRACKS.md)

<!-- TODO(argent/eallred): Add recommended process for:

- Issue triage and milestone management
- Feature management
- Experimental features
- Alpha/beta/GA maturity
