# Google Summer of Code 2023 ideas at Knative

Knative community is participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSOC) program, part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

As CNCF is driving the participation, Knative community is following their guidelines for the program in general. Please check [CNCF mentoring repository](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring) for up-to-date information.

However, we collect ideas in our community until Google announces the program and accepts CNCF as a participating organization. Afterwards, all the ideas here will be copied to CNCF mentoring repository.

## Ideas
- [Multiple Knative Eventing control planes](#multiple-knative-eventing-control-planes)

### Multiple Knative Eventing control planes

- Description: We see more users asking for complete isolation in Knative Eventing deployments. While there are Knative Eventing components that support isolated data planes, we are interested in to see isolated control planes as well. There were discussions about this in the community before and many of the asks were left unadressed. However, we have tools that support multitenancy today, such as [kcp](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp). We see this project as an experiment.
- Expected outcome: Finding issues blocking multiple control planes, and possibly fixing them.
- Expected size of the project: 350h
- Difficulty rating: Hard
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Kubernetes, Knative, Kubernetes Controllers
