## Google Summer of Code at Knative

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC for short) is a program that brings more contributors into open
source software development. Contributors work on a programming project with an open source organization in the summer.

Knative community is participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSOC) program, part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

As CNCF is driving the participation, Knative community is following their guidelines for the program in general. Please check [CNCF mentoring repository](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring) for up-to-date information.
