## Google Summer of Code at Knative

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC for short) is a program that brings more contributors into open
source software development. Contributors work on a 1.5 or 3-month programming project with an open source
organization in the summer.

Starting with GSoC'22, Knative community will apply to the program as a participating organization.
All contributors and developers are welcome to participate in the program with the Knative Community!
