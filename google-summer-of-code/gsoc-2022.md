## Mentors

### Application period

Any Knative community member can submit ideas and volunteer to mentor students. However, Google gives a limited number of
slots, so, the community will have to select the best idea+contributor+mentor combination.

Do not hesitate to contact the [organization administrators](#organization-administrators) for any questions.

What should I do in the application period?

* First of all, make sure you are aware of the expectations from you (see below).
* Check out the program [website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
* Understand how the program [works](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works).
* Read the [mentor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) of the program.
* Check out the [differences](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/11/expanding-google-summer-of-code-in-2022.html)
  in the program this year, if you have experience with GSoC before.
* Add your idea to the [idea list](#idea-list) below. The earlier, the better.
* Monitor the [communication channels](#communication) for potential contributor questions.

Expectations from mentors:

* Add your ideas [below](#idea-list).
* Make sure you have the capacity to mentor a contributor. It is not the entire Knative community mentoring a
  contributor; it is YOU mentoring the contributor. This depends on the complexity of the project and the technical
  knowledge of the contributor, but expect to spend 4 hours a week as a general rule.
* Help the contributor to not only finish their projects but also teach about matters that are part of an open source
  community such as how project governance is, how communication in the community works and similar.
* Read the [mentor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) of the program.
* Do NOT share any private information about the contributor candidates publicly, such as if you would like to mentor a
  specific candidate or if you think the candidate is not good enough for the program. Reach out to the administrators for
  that.

Tips:

* Be polite and understanding! Not everyone has your knowledge of the technology we are working on at Knative community.
* Be professional! Don't forget that the contributors could be part of the community one day.
* Send a link to this page to the contributors when you think they can benefit from the tips written here.
* Do not hesitate to contact the [administrators](#organization-administrators).

### Idea list


#### Improve Knative Eventing Observability End-to-End by addressing top issues identified by community  

Summary of idea: Today, Knative Eventing has some support for observability 
[1](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/observability/logging/collecting-logs/)
[2](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/accessing-traces/)
[3](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/troubleshooting/)
but it is piecewise and user needs for end-to-end observability are not fully addressed 
[4](https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/3387)
[5](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka/issues/29)
[6](https://github.com/lionelvillard/kn-trace).
The idea is to find out what are the biggest gaps in Knative Eventing by asking the community. 
Then to find a few issues that are “low hanging” fruits that can be solved during summer 
with the overall goal to to simplify end-to-end observability by improving 
support for OpenTelemetry in Knative Eventing and/or create a new plugin(s) for kn CLI. 

We see that work to be accomplished in stages:

Initial Stage: Few weeks of getting used to knative-eventing with few sample applications, 
reach out to Knative Eventing community via mailing list and Knative Slack 
to ask for interviews or feedback on what are biggest problems 
with observability in Knative Eventing

-Feature A (few weeks)
First Stage: Identify the highest priority problem that can be solved in 1-2 weeks (small size)
Share the solution, gather feedback

-Feature B (few weeks)
Second Stage: Either improve the Feature A solution and/or address larger problem 3-4 weeks

Final Stage (last weeks of summer): Write Knative docs, blog post, advertise

Knowledge prerequisite: Golang

Github repo: knative-sandbox 

Skill level: Intermediate to Advanced
