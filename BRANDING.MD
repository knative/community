## Knative Brand Guidelines

The Knative trademark and ![Knative Logo](icons/logo.svg "The Knative Logo")
logo (“Knative Trademarks”) are trademarks of Google, and are treated separately from the copyright or patent license grants contained in the Apache-licensed Knative repositories on GitHub. Any use of the Knative Trademarks other than those permitted in these guidelines must be approved in advance. 



### 1. Purpose of the Brand Guidelines

These guidelines exist to ensure that the Knative project can share its platform under open source licenses while making sure that the “Knative” brand is protected as a meaningful source identifier in a way that’s consistent with trademark law. 



### 2. Acceptable Uses

Given the open nature of Knative, you may use the Knative trademark to refer to the project without prior written permission in accordance with these guidelines.

Examples of approved references include the following:


*   To refer to the Knative project itself;
*   To link to knative.dev;
*   To refer to unmodified source code or other files shared by the Knative repositories on GitHub;
*   In blog posts, news articles, or educational materials about Knative;
*   To accurately identify that your design or implementation is based on or is for use with the Knative platform.

Suggested templates: 

*   “[Your Product] for Knative.”
*   “[XYZ] Conference for Knative Users.”

### 3. Usage Guidelines

*   The Knative name may not be used or registered in a manner that would cause confusion as to Google’s affiliation or endorsement (as the trademark owner).
*   Don’t use the Knative name as part of your company name, product name, domain name, or social media profile.
*   Other than as permitted by these guidelines, the Knative name should not be combined with other trademarks, terms, or source identifiers.
*   Don't remove, distort or alter any element of the Knative Trademarks without permission:
    *   Do not shorten, abbreviate, or change the spelling of the Knative name, for example in mass communication, product names, social media profiles, domain names or event names).
    *   Do not change the color or design elements of the Knative logo, or combine the logo with any other text.
*   User groups, social media accounts, community websites, or other community-organized properties or organizations should follow the naming convention "[XYZ] for Knative Users" or "[XYZ] for Knative Contributors". 
*   The name "Knative Working Group" can only be used by approved working groups maintaining code in the Knative GitHub organization under Knative Project governance.
*   If you’re organizing a conference or educational event, you can use the word Knative to refer to the technology that the event covers. However, Knative cannot be contained in the title name for your conference or educational event (such as KnativeConf or Knative Conference) without further explanation. An example of an appropriate usage could be “XYZ Conference for Knative Users” with XYZ being your own brand name. Any promotional materials should also prominently disclaim any official affiliation with or endorsement by Google and the Knative project.
*   Don’t use the Knative logo on product UI, or promotional materials without the Knative trademark owner’s  prior written permission. The Knative [Trademark Committee](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/TRADEMARK-COMMITTEE.md#getting-in-touch) will coordinate any communications with the trademark owner.
*   You may use the Knative name or logo for non-commercial swag purposes.
*   Don't use the Knative name or logo to indicate that your design or implementation is compatible with Knative without prior written permission. 

The Knative Trademark Committee understands the community desire for a conformance standard, and we do plan to implement one at a future date. We also recognize that conformance is a complicated issue with many variables, and it is still early days for the Knative project. For comparison, the Kubernetes project did not implement the [Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance) until version 1.7. Our goal is to have a Conformance Working Group created soon.

The Knative Trademark Owner and the Knative Trademark Committee reserve the right to deny trademark permission for specific use cases if the use case would not be in the best interest of the Knative Community.
